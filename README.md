    <summary>###My coding journey</summary>
	
I started learning to code around 5 years ago when I created my first web page. Over time I learned technologies like PHP, Javascript, Vue, Scss, PosgreSQL, MySQL and I created a lot of web apps using this. I am a quick learner, dedicated, highly organized with attention to detail. I like to work in groups because I know it‚Äôs almost impossible to create something meaningful alone. I am also very motivated and passionate. At university, we learned how to use git for group work. We are using Java, .NET for programming. Thanks to my studies I learned a lot about design patterns, SCRUM methodology, test cases, object-oriented programming, working with databases, working with team on projects and much more. Besides school, I am curently part of the teams which work on website for school formula team and a website for apartment booking  in Czech Republic where we use Vue.js and Tailwind.
